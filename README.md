# Python-Sorting - Sorting Alogrithms

In this project I will be implementing different solutions to solve the same problem: sorting a list of integers in ascending orders. I will also be using my new knowledge of complexity analysis to evaluate each implementations effeciency

## MVP Tasks

* Iterative Sorting
    * Implement bubble_sort and selection_sort in iterative_sorting.py
    * Run testing of the implementation by running test_iterative.py
    * Implement count_sort in iterative_sorting.py

* Recursive Sorting
    * Implement merge_sort in recursive_sorting.py
    * Run testing of the implementation by running test_recursive.py
    * Implement an in-place version of merge_sort that does not allocate any additional memory. In other words, the space complexity for this function should be O(1).
    * Implement the timsort algorithm, which is a real-world sorting algorithm. In fact, it is the sorting algorithm that is used when you run Python's built-in sort method.
